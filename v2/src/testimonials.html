          ‚ÄûI am delighted to write a recommendation for Jan, a talented front-end developer whom I had the pleasure of working with at Primer for two years. Although we didn't work directly together, I had the opportunity to observe his work closely and was consistently impressed by his contributions to the team.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jan played a critical role in building the initial versions of our dashboard, and his technical expertise was instrumental in creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface. He demonstrated exceptional resilience throughout his tenure at Primer, consistently delivering high-quality work and stepping up to the plate during the most challenging times.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond his technical skills, Jan was an incredibly kind and friendly person who was always willing to lend a helping hand to his colleagues. He was a valued member of our team thanks to his collaborative nature and attitude.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Jan for any front-end development position. He is a skilled and hardworking developer who has proven himself to be a reliable and valuable team player. I am confident that he will continue to excel in his career and make significant contributions to any organization lucky enough to work with him.‚Äú
